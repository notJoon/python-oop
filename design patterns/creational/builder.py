""" Builder (Creational Patterns) 

Seperate the construction of a complex object
same construction process can create differnet representation

Use this pattern when
    1. for creating complex object should be independent
    2. the construction process must allow differnet representations 
    for the object that's constructed.

Participants
    * Builder 
        - Specifies an abstract interface for creating parts of a Product object.
    * ConcreteBuilder:
        - constructs and assembles parts of the proiduct by implementing the Builder interface.
        - defines and keeps track of the representation it creates.
        - provides an interface for retreiving the product.
    * Director
        - constructs an object using the Builder interface
    * Product
        - prepresents the complex object under construction
        - includes classes that define the constitute parts
        - including interfaces for assembling the parts into the final result

Pros an Cons
    * Pros
        - can construct objects step-by-step, defer construction steps or run steps recursively.
        - reuse the same construction code when building various representations of products.
        - Single Responsibility Principle
    * Cons
        - complexity of the code increases
